README for Temporal fMRI Dynamics Map Dopamine Physiology

System Requirements
The Jupyter notebooks are run using the Anaconda Python distribution on a M1 Mac Laptop running OS Sonoma 14.6. Package requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file. The software has only been tested using this setup.

Installation Guide
Install Anaconda, then the following packages:
pandas
Numpy
nibabel
matplotlib
Seaborn
Statsmodels
Scipy
patsy
Moss

It may be necessary to install the specific versions as described in requirements.txt.

Demo/Instructions
The data required to run the files are included in repository. Execute the cells sequentially. Figures and statistical results in notebooks are expected to be reproduced exactly.

Description of Files

The following code reproduces the key figures in the paper. Note that Figure 3 and 4 also contain code for Figures S2 and S3.
fig2_paper.ipynb
fig3_paper.ipynb
fig4_paper.ipynb
fig5_paper.ipynb

Analysis_code
The scripts in this folder run on large data files not stored on GitHub. They extract and process data and save outputs into CSV formats, where are located in the csvs folder and read by the above scripts.

extract_lags_dopa.ipynb
This script extracts the median hemodynamic latency from PET ROIs and compiles them in a CSV for PET-latency comparisons

lag_analysis.ipynb
This script extracts the median hemodynamic latency from Harvard-Oxford ROIs and implements artery control analyses for Figure 2

lag_artery_zones.ipynb
This script conducts the control analysis to determine whether ACA and MCA arterial zones are associated with different hemodynamic latencies

MSC.ipynb
This script processes the Midnight Scan Club data and implements the noise model

lag_analysis-cocaine.ipynb
This script processes the cocaine use disorder dataset and implements the classifier and spatial importance weights analyses.
